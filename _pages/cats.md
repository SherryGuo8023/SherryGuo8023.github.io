# Journey in Cat Rescue

After losing our first cat Cola - a beautiful blue British Shorthair from a backyard breeder - to congenital heart disease at just 2.5 years old, our family became passionate advocates for responsible pet adoption and rescue. This heartbreaking experience taught us the importance of opposing unethical breeding practices and supporting adoption. We hope that through practical actions, more cats will not suffer the same hardships as him and will not repeat the same mistakes.

## Our Philosophy
- "Adopt Don't Shop"
- Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR)
- Oppose unethical breeding and pet cafes
- Prioritize adoption from shelters and street rescues
- Provide emergency care for injured or vulnerable strays

Through these experiences, we've learned that every small act of kindness can make a huge difference in an animal's life. We continue our mission to help stray cats while advocating for responsible pet ownership and adoption.
