## Hiüê±

I'm a game developer and AI explorer, focusing on creating meaningful player experiences through AI innovation. Currently leading AI social gaming development research at Kotoko AI, where we explore how AI agents can enhance player interactions and social experiences in gaming environments.

## Focus
- Player-AI Interaction in Social Gaming
- Multi-agent Systems
- Procedural Content Generation
- User Experience in AI-enhanced Gaming

## Current Work
AI'm pioneering real-time multi-agent LLM systems that enable AI-driven characters to interact naturally in 3D environments. Our research focuses on understanding how AI can serve as social catalysts in gaming spaces, validated through extensive player studies and community engagement.

## Background
I hold an MSc in Game and Media Technology from Utrecht University, where I specialized in procedural content generation and crowd simulation. My journey from physics (BSc, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences) to game technology reflects my passion for combining scientific rigor with creative innovation.

## Gaming & Development
As both a passionate gamer and professional game developer, I've cultivated a deep appreciation for various genres, particularly RTS, shooters, puzzle games, roguelikes, and idle games. My professional journey includes contributions to notable titles such as Once Human (PC Survival Game, Starry Studio) and Metal Slug: Awakening (Mobile, Tencent), alongside unannounced action mobile games and AAA shooter projects.

### Philosophy & Vision
I view games as an art form that pushes the boundaries of technology while delivering exceptional player experiences through gameplay and visual excellence. Games serve as natural proving grounds for AI advancement, exemplified by the groundbreaking achievements of AlphaGo and AlphaStar. The latter's mastery of StarCraft II - my favorite game where I main Zerg and love Sarah Kerrigan - demonstrated AI's potential in handling complex, incomplete-information environments.

What truly drives me is the endless potential for innovation in gaming. From Overwatch's revolutionary sound design (which inspired my career path) to the integration of AI agents in modern games, I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible in interactive entertainment. Games not only bridge academia and industry but continuously challenge the limits of computational capabilities and human experience.


## Life & Cats
Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm deeply committed to cat rescue and welfare, advocating for Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) and "Adopt Don't Shop". I'm a strong advocate for responsible pet adoption. Together with my family, we've rescued and rehomed numerous cats, with Guagua, Lily, and Spot becoming permanent members of our family.
