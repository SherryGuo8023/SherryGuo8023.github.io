## Overview
Developed an innovative automated framework for generating multi-layered 3D city environments from OpenStreetMap data, specifically designed for large-scale crowd simulation. The system automatically processes complex urban structures, including bridges and tunnels, providing a reliable environmental foundation for crowd simulation research.

## Technical Highlights

### Multi-layered Environment Generation
- Designed a robust geometric processing pipeline for multi-layer structure analysis
- Innovatively resolved spatial overlapping issues caused by bridges and tunnels
- Implemented seamless layer connections including ramps and transition structures
- Ensured each layer maintains non-overlapping properties with proper inter-layer connectivity

### Geographic Data Processing
- Developed an efficient OpenStreetMap data parsing and processing system
- Implemented automatic extraction of urban features including buildings, road networks, and terrain
- Supported 3D scene reconstruction for any global location
- Integrated tiled geographic vector data for optimized rendering and feature lookups

### Simulation Environment Integration
- Seamlessly integrated with SimCrowds engine for large-scale crowd simulation
- Automated division of walkable spaces and obstacles
- Generated Explicit Corridor Map (ECM) for crowd navigation in multi-layered environments

### Research Impact
- Master's Thesis Research at Utrecht University in collaboration with uCrowds
- Successfully validated through extensive testing in complex urban scenarios
- Contributed to the field of automated 3D city reconstruction for simulation purposes
