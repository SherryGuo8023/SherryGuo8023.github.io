## Overview
Developed an innovative machine learning approach to predict topological properties of materials using BERT language model. This research (2018-2019) was one of the earliest applications of NLP models in materials science, predicting a direction that would later be recognized by 2024 Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry.

## Technical Highlights

### Novel Data Processing Pipeline
- Transformed materials data into NLP-compatible format using one-hot encoding
- Converted chemical formulas into vector representations
- Achieved ~89.5% prediction accuracy on test dataset
- Processed over 14,000 materials (9,776 non-topological + 5,001 topological)

### BERT-based Classification System
- Adapted BERT model for materials property prediction
- Implemented custom tokenization for chemical formulas
- Developed multi-label binary classification model
- Utilized transfer learning from pre-trained language models
