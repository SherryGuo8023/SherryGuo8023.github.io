## Overview
Developed a predictive tool for city crowd simulation during a 48-hour hackathon, winning [Second Prize](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6789168056292646912/) among 23 international teams. Our Dutch/Latvian/Chinese team ([Team ÄŒupa](https://eventornado.com/submission/pulasim?s=1#ideas )) created an open-source solution integrating OpenStreetMap data with crowd simulation.


## Technical Highlights
- Developed large-scale crowd simulation (50,000+ agents)
- Built OpenStreetMap data importer
- Successfully simulated crowd flows in Riga and Amsterdam

## Applications
- Major event crowd analysis
- Urban planning optimization
- Emergency evacuation planning
