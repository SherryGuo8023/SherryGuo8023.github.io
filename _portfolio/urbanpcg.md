## Overview
Developed a comprehensive procedural pipeline for generating 4kmÂ² urban environments at NetEase Games. The system automatically generates road networks, buildings, and terrain based on heightmap inputs, creating diverse and realistic cityscapes.

## Technical Highlights

### Road Network Generation
- Developed in Houdini to generate complex road networks adapting to terrain
- Multi-level road hierarchy system with intelligent intersection planning
- Different distribution patterns for urban centers vs suburbs

### Building Generation System
- Implemented Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm with bitmask constraints
- Created modular architecture system with parametric controls
- Generated diverse building styles while maintaining architectural coherence

### Urban Environment Integration
- Terrain-adaptive placement and construction
- Optimized real-time rendering for large-scale visualization
